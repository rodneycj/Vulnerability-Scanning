Abstract: This lab requires 2 virtual machines. One will be Greenbone Security Manager (which can be accessed through the browser like Splunk) and the other one will be Metasploitable 2. Metasploitable 2 is intentionally vulnerable so you can see how different vulnerabilities show up on a scan.

Objectives: Configure Greenbone Security Manager, and scan a vulnerable system with Greenbone Security Manager
